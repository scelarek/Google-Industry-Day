Instead of manually entering survey responses in a spreadsheet, use Forms. Create your survey in Forms and send responses instantly to a spreadsheet in Sheets. The spreadsheet is linked to your survey, so new responses appear in real time.

Select response destination.

Learn how
""""
Use BigQuery data
""""

You can access, analyze, visualize, and share billions of rows of data from your spreadsheet with Connected Sheets, the new BigQuery data connector.

Collaborate with partners, analysts, or other stakeholders in a familiar spreadsheet interface.
Ensure a single source of truth for data without additional .csv exports.
Streamline collaboration using delegated access.
Learn how
""""
Compile data from separate spreadsheets
""""

If you keep data in separate Google Sheets, you can copy a range of data from one spreadsheet to another with the IMPORTRANGE function.

For example, you may track quarterly sales data for a product in a different spreadsheet for each region. To combine all that quarterly sales data, copy the data from each region's spreadsheet into a single spreadsheet using IMPORTRANGE.

Learn how
""""
Create reports from Analytics data
""""

Want to get insights from customers so you can make better business and marketing decisions? Use Google Analytics to see how visitors find and use your site—and keep them coming back. Then, use Analytics add-on to import your data into Sheets. After your data is in Sheets, you can clean it up, create graphs, and share your findings with your team.

Searching for data and updating it doesn’t have to be time-consuming. You can quickly find and update text or numbers in Sheets.

Find and replace appears under the File option in the menu.

Learn how
""""
Protect data from being updated
""""

If you don’t want people to change the content in a spreadsheet, you can protect it. This shouldn’t be used as a security measure. People can print, copy, paste, and import and export copies of a protected spreadsheet. Only share spreadsheets with people you trust.

Tip: If ""Protected sheets and ranges"" isn't visible, you're likely in Microsoft Office editing. To use sheets and ranges protection, convert your file to Google Sheets. Learn about Microsoft Office editing and how to convert Microsoft Office files.

Learn how
""""
Automate tasks with macros
""""
Save time by automating repetitive tasks with macros in Google Sheets. Say you need to format new data imports or build the same chart across multiple sheets of quarterly data. Repeating the same steps manually can take hours. Use a Sheets macro to record these actions and easily use them again without having to write code.

Find the ""Record macro"" option  in a sheet by clicking ""Macros"" under ""Extensions"".

If your sales team is tracking their revenue in a spreadsheet, set up rules to change the cell color when they reach their target.

Duplication errors and spaces are a common problem that can be costly and easy to miss, especially in big data. 

Remove unwanted, duplicate data. Cells with identical values but different letter cases, formatting, or formulas are considered duplicates.
Remove extra leading spaces, trailing spaces, or excessive spaces from your data. This helps reduce problems when searching for data strings.
On a sheet, click Data, then Remove duplicates. Select cells, then click Remove duplicates.
