### The Challenge

Google posed the question:

> "How might we educate users of new AI-related features becoming a part of a product, while maintaining user trust and avoiding misunderstandings about AI?"

---

### Our Solution

To address this challenge, we propose:

**Sidebard**: A sidebar for all Google Suite Products that is empowered with AI. This sidebar will feature an advanced chatbot that sources information directly from Google's extensive help resources and usage guidelines to answer user queries and elevate their product experience. More than just a tool, it would symbolize Google's commitment to user education and mastery in the era of AI-driven innovations.
